1. Simulate a binary landscape encoded 0 and 1. This could be for example a matrix of forest and non-forest. Like we did this already in `6b_walkthrough.R`. 

2. Create two different dispersal kernels: 
  i. The animal moves with constant step-lengths that follows a gamma distribution with shape 2 and scale 5. 
  ii. The animal moves with the same step-length distribution as in i) but now shows a preference for habitat 1.
  iii. The animal moves with the same step-length distribution as in i) but now shows a preference for habitat 1 and high directional persistence (kappa = 5).
