1. Read the data set `data/elephants.csv` (note file paths always start globally). Create a track using, make sure that you set the CRS to 4326. Ensure that the timezone is "GMT". 

2. Transform the track to a projected UTM CRS. You can use 32630 (https://epsg.io/32630) and filter only for the individual `"Salif Keita"`. Only use data for the year 2009.

3. Create a suitable data set for the `moveHMM` package and prepare data to fit a HMM.

4. Fit two model (`m1` and `m2`). For each model use two states. For the second model use temperature as covariate that can effect the transition probabilities between states. Which of the two models would you choose?
