# Review of iSSA

## Review of iSSA

Availability in (i)SSA is defined at the step level.

- Analyzed with *conditional* logistic regression, comparing used and available for each observed step paired with many available steps.

- Allows time-varying covariates.

---

## Review of iSSA

Unlike *unconditional* HSFs, (i)SSFs are appropriate for movement data with high fix rates.

---

## Review of iSSA

Ordinary step-selection analysis estimates habitat selection parameters with **bias**.

- Due to the unmodeled dependency between realized movement and realized habitat selection.

- Sampling available steps from the observed movement distributions propagates this correlation to the conditional logistic regression.

---

## Review of iSSA

*Integrated* step-selection analysis parameterizes two independent processes:

1. Movement-free habitat selection

2. Selection-free movement

These two processes combine to give rise to the observed movement trajectory.

---

## Review of iSSA

iSSA requires available steps to be sampled from a theoretical distribution.

- Distributions must be from the exponential family to be fit via GLM.

- Step lengths and turn angles are modeled separately.

- Movement parameters estimated by GLM *adjust* tentative distribution to estimate the parameters of the true selection-free movement distribution.

---

## Review of iSSA

Habitat selection parameters can still be interpreted using (log-)RSS.

- RSS is how many times more steps you expect to land in habitat `\(x_1\)` vs. habitat `\(x_2\)`, conditional on the starting location of the step and the movement parameters.

  - Don't forget the conditional nature of steps.
  
???

Note that "how many times more steps" is equivalent to "how much more likely" over the long run. I.e., we can interpret the expected value or the probability.

---

## Review of iSSA

Unlike unconditional HSFs, (i)SSF selection coefficients cannot be easily projected into geographic space.

- In some cases, steady-state utilization distributions can be estimated analytically.

- In most cases, the easiest solution is to obtain the UD via simulation.

  - Also gives the flexibility to estimate a transient UD or a steady-state UD.

---
class: inverse
## Take-home messages

- (i)SSFs define availability at the step level and so are appropriate for high-fix-rate movement data.

- Use iSSA to avoid the bias introduced by ordinary SSA.

  - Sample available steps from a theoretical, rather than empirical, distribution.
  - Include movement parameters in the GLM.
  
- Intepretation of `\(\beta\)`s is still log-RSS.

- Use simulation from a fitted iSSF to estimate transient or steady-state UDs.

---
class: center, middle

Recall that the `\(\beta\)`s from a fitted exponential habitat selection model can be interpreted as the log-RSS for a one-unit change in that covariate.

**What if the log-RSS depends on another variable?**

---

## Interactions in GLMs

Let's consider a simple Gaussian GLM.

`$$\mu_i = \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^k \beta_j x_{j,i}$$`

`$$y_i \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2)$$`

---

## Interactions in GLMs

Let's assume our model has 2 covariates, `\(x_1\)` and `\(x_2\)`, and we would like to include an interaction between `\(x_1\)` and `\(x_2\)` in the model. This implies that we need to estimate 3 slope parameters `\((\beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3)\)`.

`$$\mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1,i} + \beta_2 x_{2,i} + \beta_3 x_{1,i} x_{2,i}$$`

`$$y_i \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2)$$`

---

## Interactions in GLMs

For brevity, I'm going to drop the observation subscript `\((i)\)`.

`$$\mu = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_1 x_2$$`

---

## Interactions in GLMs

`$$\mu = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_1 x_2$$`

To create the interaction variable, we literally multiply `\(x_1\)` by `\(x_2\)`.

This works for any covariate, including categorical covariates (which are represented by binary dummy variables).

---

## Parameters as functions

.center[ We can think of the parameters in an interaction as linear functions of each other.] 

---

## Parameters as functions

`$$\mu = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_1 x_2$$`
&lt;br&gt;

--

$$\mu = \beta_0 + [\beta_1 x_1 + \beta_3 x_1 x_2] + \beta_2 x_2 $$
&lt;br&gt;

--

`$$\mu = \beta_0 + [\beta_1 + \beta_3 x_2] x_1 + \beta_2 x_2$$`
&lt;br&gt;

---

## Parameters as functions

`$$\mu = \beta_0 + [\beta_1 + \beta_3 x_2] x_1 + \beta_2 x_2$$`
&lt;br&gt;

$$Let \space \beta^*_1 = \beta_1 + \beta_3 x_2 $$

--

$$ \Rightarrow $$

`$$\mu = \beta_0 + \beta^*_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2$$`

`$$\beta^*_1 = f(x_2) = \beta_1 + \beta_3 x_2$$`

---

## Parameters as functions

`$$\beta^*_1 = f(x_2) = \beta_1 + \beta_3 x_2$$`

.center[ ![Beta-star figure](figs/beta_star_1.png) ]

The main effect `\((\beta_1)\)` is the intercept, and the interaction slope `\((\beta_3)\)` is the slope.

---

## Parameters as functions

`$$\beta^*_1 = f(x_2) = \beta_1 + \beta_3 x_2$$`

Since the `\(\beta\)`s in our analyses can be interpreted as log-RSS, interactions allow us to define the log-RSS for a one-unit change in one variable as a *function* of another variable.

---

## Parameters as functions

Note that this the case for either interacting variable.

`$$\mu = \beta_0 + \beta^*_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2$$`
`$$\beta^*_1 = f(x_2) = \beta_1 + \beta_3 x_2$$`

&lt;br&gt;
.center[OR]

`$$\mu = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta^*_2 x_2$$`
`$$\beta^*_2 = g(x_1) = \beta_2 + \beta_3 x_1$$`


---
## Parameters as functions

BUT NOT the case for both interacting variables.

`$$\mu \neq \beta_0 + \beta^*_1 x_1 + \beta^*_2 x_2$$`
&lt;br&gt;
`$$\beta^*_1 = f(x_2) = \beta_1 + \beta_3 x_2$$`
`$$\beta^*_2 = g(x_1) = \beta_2 + \beta_3 x_1$$`


---

## Parameters as functions

(This is true, but don't dwell on it -- it's not the point.)

`$$\mu = \beta_0 + \beta^*_1 x_1 + \beta^*_2 x_2$$`
&lt;br&gt;
`$$\beta^*_1 = f(x_2) = \beta_1 + \frac{1}{2}\beta_3 x_2$$`
`$$\beta^*_2 = g(x_1) = \beta_2 + \frac{1}{2}\beta_3 x_1$$`

---

## Interactions with a quadratic term

Sometimes we want to model the relationship between `\(\mu\)` and `\(x\)` with a parabola, *e.g.*, if we are modeling habitat selection as a function of a **condition**.

.center[ ![Parabola for beta-star](figs/res_cond_intxn.png) ]

---

## Interactions with a quadratic term

It is important to remember that the location of the vertex of a parabola depends upon both the first-order and the second-order term (*we already saw this when we simulated data in the HSF module*).

For a parabola of the form:

`$$\mu = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_1^2$$`

The vertex is located at:

`$$(x,y) = \left(\frac{-\beta_1}{2\beta_2}, \frac{-\beta_1^2}{4\beta_2} + \beta_0\right)$$`

???

Don't memorize this! What's important is that you realize that you need all of those parameters in your model.

---

## Interactions with a quadratic term

If you want to estimate a parabola that changes with another variable, you need an interaction with both `\(x_1\)` and `\(x_1^2\)`.

`$$\mu = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_1^2 + \beta_3 x_2 + \beta_4 x_1 x_2 + \beta_5 x_1^2 x_2$$`

---

## Interactions with a quadratic term

We can rearrange as before and see that

`$$\mu = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_1^2 + \beta_3 x_2 + \beta_4 x_1 x_2 + \beta_5 x_1^2 x_2$$`

`$$= \beta_0 + \beta^*_1 x_1 + \beta^*_2 x_1^2 + \beta_3 x_2$$`

&lt;br&gt;

`$$\beta^*_1 = f(x_2) = \beta_1 + \beta_4 x_2$$`
`$$\beta^*_2 = g(x_2) = \beta_2 + \beta_5 x_2$$`

*I.e.*, both the linear and the quadratic parameters are linear functions of `\(x_2\)`.

---

## Interactions with a quadratic term

This also implies that the location of the vertex (*e.g.*, the most preferred condition) is a function of `\(x_2\)`. 

*E.g.*, the x-coordinate is:

`$$x = \frac{-\beta^*_1}{2\beta^*_2} = -\frac{\beta_1 + \beta_4 x_2}{2(\beta_2 + \beta_5 x_2)}$$`

???

Don't memorize this! What's important is that you realize that you need all four of those parameters in your model.

---

## Interactions with a quadratic term

Equivalently, we can rearrange as:

`$$\mu = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_1^2 + \beta^*_3 x_2$$`

&lt;br&gt;

`$$\beta^*_3 = h(x_1) = \beta_3 + \beta_4 x_1 + \beta_5 x_1^2$$`

*I.e.*, `\(\beta^*_3\)` is a quadratic function of `\(x_1\)`.

---
class: inverse
## Take-home messages

- An interaction variable is created by multiplying together the two (or more) interacting variables.
  - This applies to any variable, continuous or categorical.
  
- Interactions can be thought of as expressing the slope of one of the interacting variables as a function of the other variable.

- Since our slope parameters are directly interpretable as log-RSS, interactions allow us to write the log-RSS for a variable as a function of another variable.

- Interactions with a parabola should include both the linear and quadratic terms.

# Interactions between Habitat Variables

---

## Interactions between habitat variables

Let's begin by considering an interaction between two habitat variables.

---

## Interactions between habitat variables

As we've already discussed, we can classify habitat axes as resources, risks, or conditions.

---

### Resource-risk interaction

.pull-left[ 
*E.g.*, an animal might avoid patches with high resource density if predation risk is also high `\((\beta_{res} &gt; 0; \beta_{intxn} &lt; 0)\)`.

![Resource-Risk Interaction](figs/res_risk_intxn1.png) 
]

.pull-right[ 
*E.g.*, an animal might accept patches with high risk resource density is also high `\((\beta_{risk} &lt; 0; \beta_{intxn} &gt; 0)\)`.

![Resource-Risk Interaction](figs/res_risk_intxn2.png) 
]

---

### Resource-condition interaction

*E.g.*, an animal might avoid foraging in places where it is too cold or too hot.

.center[ ![Resource-Condition Interaction](figs/res_cond_intxn.png) ]

---

### Risk-condition interaction

*E.g.*, an arboreal animal might be most vulnerable to predation at intermediate canopy cover.

.center[ ![Risk-Condition Interaction](figs/risk_cond_intxn.png) ]

---

### Resource-resource interaction

If resources are *perfectly substitutable*, then they combine additively in a model `\((\beta_{intxn} = 0)\)`.

Two resources can be *antagonistic* if they only partially substitute each other, such that the consumer requires more total resources `\((\beta_{intxn} &lt; 0)\)`.

Two resources can be *complementary* if they augment each other, such that the consumer requires fewer total resources `\((\beta_{intxn} &gt; 0)\)`.

.note[See Matthiopoulos et al. 2020 for more discussion of this. Resource substitutability terms from Tilman (1980).]

---
### Resource-resource interaction

.pull-left[ 
Resource antagonism `\((\beta_{intxn} &lt; 0)\)`.  

![Resource antagonism](figs/res_antag.png) 
]

.pull-right[ 
Resource complementarity `\((\beta_{intxn} &gt; 0)\)`.  

![Resource complementarity](figs/res_comp.png) 

]

.note[Note in both cases that the log-RSS remains positive.]

# Interactions between Movement and Habitat Variables

---

## Interactions between movement and habitat variables

Recall that the `\(\beta\)`s for the movement parameters adjust the tentative movement distributions.

--

If we formulate the movement parameters as functions of habitats, that will give us a different movement distribution depending on the value of the habitat.

---

## Interactions between step length and habitat

Assume we model step lengths as samples from this gamma distribution.

`$$l_{tentative} \sim gamma(k_0 = 3, q_0 = 100)$$`

.center[ ![Tentative step-length distribution](figs/tent_sl.png) ]

---

## Interactions between step length and habitat

Recall that the selection-free step-length distribution would be:

`$$l_{updated} \sim gamma(\hat{k}, \hat{q})$$`

`$$\hat{k} = k_0 + \beta_{ln(l)}$$`

`$$\hat{q} = 1/\left(\frac{1}{q_0} - \beta_l\right)$$`

---

## Interactions between step length and habitat

Now say that our iSSF includes an interaction between the `\(\beta\)`s and a habitat variable, `\(x\)`.

`$$logit(p) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 l + \beta_3 ln(l) + \beta_4 x l + \beta_5 x ln(l)$$`

R formula: 


```r
case_ ~ sl_ * x + log_sl_ * x
```

---

## Interactions between step length and habitat

As before, we can rearrange to write the `\(\beta\)`s for `\(l\)` and `\(ln(l)\)` as functions of `\(x\)`.

`$$logit(p) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 l + \beta_3 ln(l) + \beta_4 x l + \beta_5 x ln(l)$$`

`$$logit(p) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta^*_l l + \beta^*_{ln(l)} ln(l)$$`

`$$\beta^*_l = \beta_2 + \beta_4(x)$$`

`$$\beta^*_{ln(l)} = \beta_3 + \beta_5(x)$$`

---

## Interactions between step length and habitat

That implies that our gamma distribution is now a function of `\(x\)`.

`$$l_{updated} \sim gamma(\hat{k}, \hat{q})$$`

`$$\hat{k} = k_0 + \beta^*_{ln(l)}$$`

`$$\hat{q} = 1/\left(\frac{1}{q_0} - \beta^*_l\right)$$`

`$$\beta^*_l = \beta_2 + \beta_4(x)$$`

`$$\beta^*_{ln(l)} = \beta_3 + \beta_5(x)$$`

---

## Interactions between step length and habitat

.center[ What does this look like with some numbers? ]

---

## Interactions between step length and habitat

### Continuous habitat

Say our `\(x\)` represents vegetation density, and denser vegetation makes it harder for our animal to move quickly.

.center[ ![Continuous habitat step-length distr](figs/updated_sl_cont.png) ]

---

## Interactions between step length and habitat

### Categorical habitat

Say our `\(x\)` represents habitat types, and our animal moves fastest in grassland, slowest in wetland, and intermediate in forest.

.center[ ![Categorical habitat step-length distr](figs/updated_sl_cat.png) ]

---

## Interactions between turn angle and habitat

We can do the same thing with the concentration parameter of the von Mises distribution.

*E.g.*, foraging animals (at the right timescale) typically have turn angles concentrated around `\(\pm \pi\)`, whereas traveling animals typically have turn angles concentrated around 0.

.center[ ![Continuous habitat turn angle distr](figs/updated_ta_cont.png) ]

---
class: center, middle
# Interactions between Movement Variables

---

## Interactions between movement variables

It is plausible to think that step length and turn angle might be correlated.

A travelling animal might be moving fast (long step lengths) and turning very little (turn angle concentrated around 0).

A foraging animal might be moving slowly (short step lengths) and turning quite a lot (turn angle concentrated around `\(\pm \pi\)`).
---

## Interactions between movement variables

An interaction between step length and turn angle can capture this correlation.

.center[ ![Turn angle by step length](figs/updated_ta_sl.png) ]
---

class: center, middle
# Interactions with Other Variables

---

## Interactions with other variables

You may have other hypotheses about how some factor affects habitat selection and/or movement.

---

## Interactions with temporal variables

Perhaps your animal is primarily nocturnal. Maybe they have long movements during the night and short movements during the day.

Include an interaction between step length (and maybe log step length) and time-of-day.

---

## Interactions with temporal variables

Perhaps your animal is primarily nocturnal. Maybe they like to sleep in forests during the day, but they forage in grasslands at night.

Include an interaction between habitat type and time-of-day.

---

## Interactions with temporal variables

Temporal interactions can be at a coarser scale, too.

For example, maybe you are studying a game species and comparing movement patterns during hunting and non-hunting seasons.

---

## Interactions with behavioral state

Maybe you've already segmented your trajectory using an HMM. By definition, your step-length and turn-angle distributions should vary with state.

Include an interaction between behavioral state and the movement parameters.

---

## Interactions with behavioral state

Maybe you've already segmented your trajectory using an HMM. Your animal might use habitat differently depending on whether they are resting, foraging, or travelling.

Include an interaction between behavioral state and the habitat parameters.

---
class: inverse
## Take-home messages

- Interactions can capture complex biological realism in a habitat selection model.

- Give careful thought to the form of interactions to understand what they mean biologically.

- Remember that the `\(\beta\)`s for habitats represent selection strength and the `\(\beta\)`s for movement represent adjustments to the tentative movement distribution.

  - If you hypothesize that selection or movement is a function of some covariate, you can include it as an interaction.

???

We were interested in whether or not sea turtles select for marine protected areas, and whether or not that selection depended on their movement mode.

We segmented our trajectories into movement modes using a Bayesian state-space model designed for use with Argos data. (see R package [bsam](https://github.com/ianjonsen/bsam).)

.center[ &lt;img src="figs/roberts_etal_fig2.png" width = 50% height = 50% alt = "Roberts et al. Fig 2"&gt; ]

???

We found that turtles selected multi-use protected areas over unprotected areas in both movement modes.

We found little support for selection of stricter no-take zones, probably because the no-take zones were very rare in the study system, and perhaps because turtles cannot perceive the differences between multi-use and no-take zones.

We determined behavioral states using a Bayesian state space model. It is similar to an HMM but (1) handles temporally irregular data and (2) handles Argos error distributions.

]

???

Note that Picardi et al. did not actually fit a model with interaction terms, but rather fit individual models and then summarized habitat selection parameters by behavioral state and reproductive state post hoc.

Conceptually, the two approaches are similar. The two-stage approach is easier to fit and less likely to lead to convergence issues than using interaction terms to fit the model.
