# Why should we care?

- Most telemetry studies consist of many animals.
- Often individual behave very differently (and we can fully account for these differences in a model).
- We are often interested in population-level effects.


# How-to account for individual differences

1. ~~Ignore individuals and fit data to all animals.~~
2. Fit an individual model for each individual. 
3. Use a mixed-model strategy.

# 2. Fit an individual model for each individual. 

- A somewhat naive approach could be, to fit to each individual animal the model of interests (e.g., a SSF or an iSSF).

- In a next step we can then "do statistics" with the coefficients of the individual model. For example, we could 
  - calculate the mean and confidence intervals to obtain population level effects, or 
  - use a linear models to relate coefficient values to other explanatory covariates. 


- A difficulty is if we have extreme observations or some levels of a categorical covariate is not observed for all animals. 

----

There are different programming strategies, how one could approach such a situation: 

a. ~~Write customized code for each individual.~~
b. Use some kind of looping structure (for example a `for`-loop). 
c. Use a nest-unnest approach, as we have seen previously (for example with the `purrr` package). 

----------

An example of this approach was used in Signer et al. 2019

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Source Signer et al. 2019"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/signer2019.jpg")
```


# 3. Use a mixed-model strategy. 


- For HSF this is *relatively* straight forward. We can make use of well established tools that were developed for GLMMs.

- For iSSFs this is slightly more challenging. We have to use a likelihood equivalent reformulation of the iSSF as a poisson regression with random effects for each strata with a fixed large variance.

## Random effects for HSFs

	
- Random effects were proposed for HSFs over 15 years ago\footnotemark[2]

- Majority of studies between 2016 and 2020 (80 %) only include random intercept and no random slope(s).

-	Generalized linear model with binomial response (GLM), random intercept (GLMM 1), and random intercept and slopes (GLMM 2).

Let us fit three models to tracking data from wild goats: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
<<goat.models>>
```

For RSF use random intercept **and** random slope(s)\footnotemark[4].

# Accounting for animal-specific variation (SSF)


\only<1->{ Conditional logistic regression with random effects is more difficult

\begin{equation*} 
\text{P}(y_{ntj}=1 \,|\, \pmb{x}_{nt\cdot}) = \pi_{ntj} = 
\frac{\exp( \pmb\beta^\top \pmb{x}_{ntj})}
{\sum_{j = 1}^J \exp( \pmb\beta^\top \pmb{x}_{nti})}  
\end{equation*}}
	
- $n = 1, \dots, N$ individuals, with realized steps, 
- time points $t = 1, \dots, T_n$, with 
- $j = 1, \dots, J_{n,t}$ location that were either used or available. 

-----

- The conditional logistic regression is a special case of the multinomial model.
- The multinomial model is likelihood-equivalent to the Poisson model.
- Thus we can rewrite to conditional logistic regression as a Poisson regression.

---- 

## SSF as poisson model

Reformulation as Poisson model\footnotemark[5] \footnotemark[6]

$$
\text{E}(y_{nti}) = \mu_{nti} = \exp(\alpha_{nt} + \pmb\beta^\top \pmb{x}_{nti} + \pmb{u}^\top \pmb{z}_{nti}) \ ,\quad y_{nti} \sim \text{Po}(\mu_{nti})
$$

- $\alpha_{nt} \sim N(0, \sigma_\alpha^2)$ are the stratum specific intercepts with $\sigma_{\alpha}^2$ being fixed at a very large value.
- $\pmb\beta^\top \pmb{x}_{nti}$  are the selection coefficients and the design matrix, respectively.
- $\pmb{u}^\top \pmb{z}_{nti}$ specify the random effect structure.

# Simulation study from Muff et al. 2020
	
- Simulation of movement for 20 animals with animal-specific selection coefficients.
- For RSFs sample random points within the availability domain
- For SSFs sample random steps from each location

# An example from Roshier et al. 2021

- This work I did together with David Roshier from Australian Wildlife Conservancy. 
- I was only involved in the statistical modeling. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/roshier21.png")
```

---

## Data

- Telemetry data for 22 individual foxes at 20 min sampling rate
- Location of water sources (in blue)

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/relocs.png")

```

---

## Analysis

1. Revisitation rates with the `recurse` package^[Bracis, C., Bildstein, K. L., & Mueller, T. (2018). Revisitation analysis uncovers spatio‐temporal patterns in animal movement data. Ecography, 41(11), 1801-1811.]
2. aKDE home ranges
3. integrated step selection analysis

----

## Questions: iSSA

- Do foxes select for pixels closer to water sources? 
- Does the selection depends on whether or not foxes are inside their home range?
- Do foxes move faster/slower when inside/outside their home range?

-----

## Habitat selection

Habitat selection of foxes inside (a) and outside (b) of their home range.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/fig_selection.png")
```


----

Expected displacement (i.e., how far do we expect a 'typical' fox to travel within a 20 minutes). 


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
