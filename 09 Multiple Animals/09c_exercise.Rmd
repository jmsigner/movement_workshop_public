1. Load the fisher data from the `amt` package and sample all individuals to the same sampling rate. You can use the function `summarize_sampling_rate_many()` to figure out a suitable sampling rage. For the actual resampling you need a loop/nesting or alike. 

2. Fit four HSFs using only the covariate elevation. Fit the following three models:
    1. Ignore individuals
    2. A model with a random intercept only
    3. A model only with a random slope

3. Use the same data set, but now fit an SSF. Fit two different models:
    1. A conditional logistic regression ignoring different individuals.
    2. Fit a model where you use the Poisson trick to account for individual variation.
